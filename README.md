In the library management system, admins can log in with a special email and password. 
They can add books, with IDs automatically assigned, by specifying the name, category, 
and shelf location. Admins manage books by updating details or deleting them. They can 
also enter, update, or delete member charges. Admins can search for books by ID or check
if a book is borrowed, viewing member details if applicable. Returned books are marked as
available. Members register with personal details and preferences, which are stored for recommendations
. Members can search for available books, subscribe to them, view their borrowed book list, and update their 
profile information. Firebase notifications remind members to return books on time.
